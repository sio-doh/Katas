DESCRIPTION:
Task
    "Given a list walls closing in at you, can you make 
        it past those walls without being hit?"
    Input
    walls: an array of 2-ples, each 2-ple storing 
        non-negative numbers representing the distance 
        of the walls closing in at you from each side 
        respectively to the center of the room.
    Output
    return a boolean indicating whether it is possible 
        to run past the walls without being hit.
Specification
    You are at the left side in the center of the room
    You want to reach the right side in the center of the room
    You can only move in a straight line across the room
    Walls are closing in at you from both sides of the room
    Walls stop once they hit the center of the room
    You and the walls move at the same speed
    You get hit by a wall if you are on the same tile as a wall
    If a wall reaches a tile ahead of you, you cannot make it 
        past that wall anymore
nput Constraints
    50 tests with 1 <= number of walls <= 4
    50 tests with 5 <= number of walls <= 15
    50 tests with 16 <= number of walls <= 50
    50 tests with 51 <= number of walls <= 100
    0 <= starting distance of walls to center of room <= 120
Examples
    In the examples below, you start on tile A and want to reach 
        tile B. You have to walk across the center of the room 
        -. Walls W are closing in on you from the north and south.
