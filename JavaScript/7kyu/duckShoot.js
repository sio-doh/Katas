DESCRIPTION:
You've arrived at a carnival and head straight for the 
duck shooting tent. Why wouldn't you?
You will be given a set amount of ammo, and an aim 
rating of between 1 and 0. No your aim is not always 
perfect - hey maybe someone fiddled with the sights on 
the gun...
Anyway your task is to calculate how many successful 
shots you will be able to make given the available ammo 
and your aim score, then return a string representing 
the pool of ducks, with those ducks shot marked with 
'X' and those that survived left unchanged. You will 
always shoot left to right.
Example of start and end duck string with two 
successful shots:
Start ---> |~~~~~22~2~~~~~|
Bang!! Bang!!
End ---> |~~~~~XX~2~~~~~|
All inputs will be correct type and never empty.

function duckShoot(ammo, aim, ducks) {
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(ammo * aim); i++) {
        ducks = ducks.replace("2", "X");
    } 
    return ducks;
}
