// DESCRIPTION:
// SITUATION
// Imagine you are trying to roll a ball a certain distance 
// down a road. The ball will have a starting speed that 
// slowly degrades due to friction and cracks in the road. 
// Every time the ball rolls a distance equal to its speed 
// or rolls over a crack, its speed decreases by 1. Given a 
// speed of s which the ball starts rolling, and a roadmap 
// r of the street represented by a string, return whether 
// or not the ball will be able to make it past the end of 
// the road (True or False).
// NOTES
//     A ball with 0 speed is motionless.
//     If a ball happens to roll over a crack, the speed 
//         decrease must only take effect after the ball has 
//         rolled a distance equal to its speed. For example, 
//         if the speed was 10, but the ball hit 2 cracks before 
//         rolling 10 distance, the ball's speed should stay at 
//         10 until it has reached 10 distance, in which the speed 
//         should decrease to 7 (-2 from cracks and -1 due to 
//         friction).
//     On the roadmap, "_" represents flat ground and "x" 
//         represents a crack
//     The length of the roadmap will be equal to the distance 
//         to the ball's final destination.
//     The ball must reach the last tile of the road for the 
//         solution to be considered valid.
// EXAMPLES
//     A speed of 100, and a roadmap of '_' should return True 
//         because the ball would be moving too quickly for friction 
//         to be applied and there are no cracks on the road.
//     A speed of 1, and a roadmap of '___________' should return 
//         False because friction would stop the ball after 1 
//         distance
