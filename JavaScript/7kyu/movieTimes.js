DESCRIPTION:
You just started working at a local cinema, and your 
first task is to write a function that returns the 
showtimes of a specific movie, given its length. In 
order to make your job easier, you will work with 
24-hour format throughout this kata.
Your function receives three parameters, all of them 
being integers:
    open - Hour at which the cinema opens.
    close - Hour at which the cinema closes.
    length - Length of the movie, in minutes.
It must return an array of times, with each time being 
in the format (hour, minute). For example, (19, 30) 
means 19:30, and (2, 0) means 02:00. The last session 
in the array cannot end after the cinema closes. Also, 
the times in the array must be sorted from earliest 
to latest.
There's also a 15-minute window between a session's 
end and the beginning of the following one, in order 
to give enough time for users to take a seat.
For example, for a cinema opening at 13:00 and closing 
at 23:00 showing a 60-minute movie, your function must 
return the following array:
    >>> movie_times(13, 23, 60)
    [(13, 0), (14, 15), (15, 30), (16, 45), (18, 0), 
        (19, 15), (20, 30), (21, 45)]
Note that the cinema might close at times such as 02:00 
or 03:00, meaning examples like this must also work:
    >>> movie_times(16, 3, 75)
    [(16, 0), (17, 30), (19, 0), (20, 30), (22, 0), 
        (23, 30), (1, 0)]
IMPORTANT: For languages other than Python, just return 
an array of arrays. See sample test cases for more info 
on how to return the list of times.
NOTE: This kata isn't meant to be too challenging, so 
opening times for all tests will be 12:00 or later, and 
closing times will always be 6:00 or earlier.
NOTE 2: Midnight will be represented as (0, 0) or 0:00 
in this kata, instead of 24:00.

function movie_times(open, close, length) {
    let result = []; 
    if (open > close) {
        close += 24;
    }
    for (let i = open * 60; i + length <= close * 60; i += (length + 15)) {
        result.push([Math.floor(i / 60) % 24, i % 60]);
    }
    return result;
}
