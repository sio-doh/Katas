DESCRIPTION:
In JavaScript, there is a special case where strict 
comparison of the same variable returns false! Try to 
find out what must be done to get such result!
    var x = something;
    x === x // returns false!
Write a function which will return value for which 
strict comparison will give false!

    return NaN;
