DESCRIPTION: 
Given an array of 4 integers
[a,b,c,d] representing two points (a, b) and (c, d), return a 
string representation of the slope of the line joining these 
two points.
For an undefined slope (division by 0), return undefined . 
Note that the "undefined" is case-sensitive.
    a:x1
    b:y1
    c:x2
    d:y2
Assume that [a,b,c,d] and the answer are all integers (no 
floating numbers!). Slope: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope

function slope(points) {
    return points[0] == points[2] ? "undefined" : 
        String((points[3] - points[1]) / (points[2] - points[0]));
