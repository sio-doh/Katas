DESCRIPTION:
The function takes in 2 inputs x and y, and should 
return x to the power of y
Simple, right? But you're NOT allowed to use 
Math.pow();
Obs: x and y will be naturals, so DON'T take fractions 
into consideration;
Note : zero to the power of zero equals one in this 
kata
Great coding <3
*/ 

power = (x, y) => x ** y;
