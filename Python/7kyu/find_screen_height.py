# DESCRIPTION:
# Cheesy Cheeseman just got a new monitor! He is happy 
# with it, but he just discovered that his old desktop 
# wallpaper no longer fits. He wants to find a new 
# wallpaper, but does not know which size wallpaper he 
# should be looking for, and alas, he just threw out the 
# new monitor's box. Luckily he remembers the width and 
# the aspect ratio of the monitor from when Bob Mortimer 
# sold it to him. Can you help Cheesy out?
# The Challenge
# Given an integer width and a string ratio written as 
# WIDTH:HEIGHT, output the screen dimensions as a string 
# written as WIDTHxHEIGHT.
# Note: The calculated height should be represented as an 
# integer. If the height is fractional, truncate it.

def find_screen_height(width, ratio): 
    ratios = ratio.split(":")
    height = (width / int(ratios[0]) * int(ratios[1]))
    return str(width) + "x" + str(int(height))
