# DESCRIPTION 
# Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
# Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in 
# the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
# You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
# If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest 
# in the original string.
# All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

            intNum += ord(word) - 96
        numArr.append(intNum)
    return arr[numArr.index(max(numArr))]
